- 👋 Hi, I’m Scott
- 👀 I’m interested in biomechanics and exercise physiology; with a new found interest in cybersecurity, and the idea of neural networks.
     I have a degree in Kinesiology and am fascinated with the brain and nervous system as a whole. I think it's pretty awesome that the brain can be used as a guide to create AI.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning computer science and python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small projects to gain experience. I'm very new to this, so I'm not even sure where to start.
